**Project Details**
####################

The project aims to read and process ``.pgn`` files which contain the hierarchy of moves, along with the statistics of a game of Chess.
The program displays the status of the chess board after performing each move and the final position of pieces on the board after the game is over.
Any ``.pgn`` or ``.txt`` file can be given as an input to this program.

Read below about the game and associated notations, or proceed to the code documentation

**About Chess**
####################

Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a checkered board with 64 squares arranged in an 8Ã—8 grid.
Play involves no hidden information. Each player begins with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. Each piece type moves differently, with the most powerful being the queen and the least powerful the pawn. The objective is to checkmate the opponent's king by placing it under an inescapable threat of capture.
In addition to checkmate, a player wins the game if the opponent resigns, or, in a timed game, runs out of time. There are also several ways that a game can end in a draw.

**Moves in a Chess Game**
#########################

+ The king moves one square in any direction. The king also has a special move called castling that involves also moving a rook. However, for a king to play a castling move, certain conditions must be met.

+ A rook can move any number of squares along a rank or file, but cannot leap over other pieces. Along with the king, a rook is involved during the king's castling move.

+ A bishop can move any number of squares diagonally, but cannot leap over other pieces.

+ The queen combines the power of a rook and bishop and can move any number of squares along a rank, file, or diagonal, but cannot leap over other pieces.

+ A knight moves to any of the closest squares that are not on the same rank, file, or diagonal. (Thus the move forms an "L"-shape: two squares vertically and one square horizontally, or two squares horizontally and one square vertically.) The knight is the only piece that can leap over other pieces.

+ A pawn can move forward to the unoccupied square immediately in front of it on the same file, or on its first move it can advance two squares along the same file, provided both squares are unoccupied (black dots in the diagram); or the pawn can capture an opponent's piece on a square diagonally in front of it on an adjacent file, by moving to that square (black "x"s). A pawn has two special moves: the en passant capture and promotion.

**The Portable Game Notation (PGN)**
#####################################

Portable Game Notation (PGN) is a plain text computer-processible format for recording chess games (both the moves and related data), supported by many chess programs. 
The chess moves themselves are given in algebraic chess notation. The usual filename extension is ``.pgn``.
PGN code begins with a set of "tag pairs" (a tag name and its value), followed by the "movetext" (chess moves with optional commentary).
